        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Ahmad Imran Bin Zulkepli, 20 years old and currently study in Diploma of Information Management in Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Cawangan Negeri Sembilan Kampus Rembau. I plan to continue my studies in Bachelor of Science (Hons.) Content Management and pursue my career in goverment sector as Foreign Service Officer. In order for me to achieve my absolute dream, I have to work hard during my years in college and give 110 percent in everything that I contribute into my life. </p>
        <span class="center"><img src="style/image 2.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
        <p>I was born and grew up in Johor Bahru and lived my life in Pasir Gudang, Johor. My father, Zulkepli Bin Wahad is a retired mechanical engineer graduated from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and my mother worked as an executive in shipping and logistics company in Pasir Gudang, Johor. Growing with my parents is really an exciting adventure especially when it comes to academic achievement hence their education and career. My father have to told me what is like to be man with dignity and integrity and my mother have taught me the meaning of compassion and loving. </p>
        <span class="center"><img src="style/image.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
        <p>After entering UiTM Rembau back in 2018 as a freshman after SPM, I found it very hard to adjust myself after away from my family but then I realised college years is just another stepping stone for me to achieve my dream and ambition. I found myself a new family in college and the family names IM110C. My journey with my new family has begun. </p>
        <span class="center"><img src="style/image 5.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
        <p>Although my new family is not as perfect as my own family, being around IM110C for nearly 5 semester for me is an exciting journey and I found each and every one of them are very kind, helpful and very supportive among each other. </p>
